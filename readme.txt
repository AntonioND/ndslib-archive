Currently the instal batch file has a set path to devkitarm.  If your compiler is not set at c:\devkitarm  then you need to modify the first like of install batch before running.  In future releases the installation proceedure will be much less hacky.

You are welcome to build and copy the files manualy.

To use simple add the ndslib\lib directory to your library search path
