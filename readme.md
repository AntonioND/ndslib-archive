# ndslib repository archive

ndslib is the predecessor of libnds, which is used to develop applications and
games for the Nintendo DS. This repository contains the history of ndslib as
extracted from the CVS repository in https://sourceforge.net/projects/ndslib/
converted to a git repository so that it can be easily accessed.

This repository is useful as reference. Sometimes, when porting old projects, it
is required to understand how old functions work (as they are no longer present
in modern versions of the libraries).

In order to preserve the history of ndslib completely untouched, the whole story
extracted from SourceForge is in the `history` branch. You can check it by
running:

```sh
git checkout history
```
